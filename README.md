# 🦠 Malaria Cell Image Classification using CNN (LeNet)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts **malaria infection** from cell images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** (LeNet architecture).
The dataset is sourced from **TensorFlow Datasets**, and the project integrates **Weights & Biases (W\&B)** for data and model versioning, experiment tracking, and hyperparameter tuning.

## 🚀 Features

* 📊 **Data Visualization**: Exploratory analysis of malaria-infected vs. uninfected cells.
* 🧹 **Preprocessing & Augmentation**: Image resizing, train-test splitting, and augmentation.
* 🗂 **Data Versioning**: Tracked dataset versions using **W\&B Artifacts**.
* 🧠 **Model Training**: Implemented **LeNet CNN** for classification.
* ⚙️ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimented with different optimizers, learning rates, and batch sizes.
* 📉 **Experiment Tracking**: Logged metrics and visualizations with **W\&B** and **TensorBoard**.
* 💾 **Model Saving & Loading**: Stored trained model for later testing and evaluation.
